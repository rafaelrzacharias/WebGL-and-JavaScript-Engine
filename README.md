# WebGL and JavaScript Engine

This project uses WebGL and JavaScript. There is only one library dependency, gl-matrix, which is included in the project.

Since the game runs on the browser, you need to emulate a server. I recomend using NetBeans 8.2 or higher and Google Chrome.

Download NetBeans and install from here: https://netbeans.org/

Get the NetBeans plugin for google Chrome from here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netbeans-connector/hafdlehgocfcodbgjnpecfajgkeejnaa?hl=en

To try the game, please open the project on NetBeans 8.2 or higher and click on the green play icon.
